# Lazy Morality

A small game that was thought of, designed and created in just under 2 hours for the [Solar2D Blitz 2023.01 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/solar2d-blitz-202301).

**Theme: "The Good, The Evil & All in between"**

I was too busy to actually create a proper game during the jam, and as some sort of meta commentary on the theme, morality in general and AI, I decided to try out different AI tools to create a game for me. The entire game, apart from the Roboto font and a few minor fixes in code, was created using the following AI tools:
- ChatGPT: code & all "moral dilemmas" and their answers found inside Data/dilemmas.lua.
- GitHub Copilot: additional code.
- Bing Image Creator: all images.
