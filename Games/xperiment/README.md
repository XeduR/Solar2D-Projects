# xperiment
A narrative driven point and click game developed during Global Game Jam 2024. The game jam's theme was "Make Me Laugh". This game takes a somewhat literal, as well as somber approach to what it may mean to make Me (the protagonist), or someone, laugh.

The game's executables can be downloaded over at [XPERIMENT - Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/xperiment-1). The executable archive contains playable builds for both Windows and macOS.

The game was developed by members of Roso Games, which is a project run by a non-profit organisation [Roso-tuotanto](https://www.rosotuotanto.fi/).
